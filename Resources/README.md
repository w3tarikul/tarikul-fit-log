## 🐣 Basic Requirements (Must Do for Everyone)

- This app must run without any errors after deployment. I will deploy it on vercel
- Add a nice README.md file with the project name, description, technologies used, and features(minimum 5)

# 🔧 Main Requirements — 


### 1. 🔝 Navbar

- I will attach downloaded image from figma on the asset folder.
- Design the Navbar exactly like the Figma design
- Put the logo on the left side
- Put the navigation links on the middle — links are: Workout, My Plan
- The active page link should look different (highlighted), just like the Figma design
- **Right-side status badges (counters)**: a "Plan" badge and a "Saved" badge, each showing a number.
  - Plan badge = filled pill with accent background (e.g. `#ccff00`).
  - Saved badge = pill with outline/border only.
--- 


### 2. 🅱️ Hero / Banner (Top of the Home page)
- Eyebrow text: **"WORKOUT LIBRARY"**.
- Main heading: **"TRAIN WITH INTENT. LOG EVERY SET."** (uppercase, bold display font, e.g. Oswald).
- Subtitle: *"FitLog is a dark, no-nonsense gym companion: pick a lift, lock it into today's plan, and watch the week's work add up."*
- A primary **CTA button with an icon**: **"BROWSE WORKOUTS"**.
  - It scrolls the user down to the `#library` section on the same page (an anchor link, not a route change).
- A **banner/hero image** on the right side.


### 2.1 Navbar behavior (see also section 1)
- The "Plan" and "Saved" badge counters in the navbar both link to `/my-plan`.
- The badge numbers reflect the number of items currently in **Today's Plan** and **Saved**.( See Requirements Below)


--- 

### 3. ⚖️ The Library Section (Home Page)
- Heading: **"THE LIBRARY"** with subtitle **"Twelve lifts covering every major muscle group."**
- Display all workouts from the API's data as cards in a **3x4 grid on large screens** (like the design). Must be responsive.
- Each card must show:
  - 📷 Illustration/image
  - 🏷️ Category tag pills (e.g. `CHEST`, `ARMS`)
  - 📛 Workout name (e.g. "BARBELL BENCH PRESS")
  - 🖇️ Equipment line (e.g. "Barbell, Bench")
  - 🔴 Stats row with icons: duration (`25 min`), calories (`180 kcal`), rating (`4.8`)
- 🧭 Clicking a card navigates the user to that workout's **Detail Page**.

--- 

### 4. Workout Details Page — Layout (two-column, follow the design)
**Left Side — Visual/Media:**
- A large image/illustration of the workout fills the column.

**Right Side — sections:**
- Title: "BARBELL BENCH PRESS"
- Subtitle/description: *"A compound press that builds chest thickness, triceps, and pressing power from a stable bench."*
- Category tags: `Chest`, `Arms`
- **Key Specs table/panel** with label + value rows:
  - EQUIPMENT / DIFFICULTY / SETS / REPS / DURATION / CALORIES / RATING
  (e.g. Barbell, Bench / Intermediate / 4 / 6-8 / 25 min / 180 kcal / 4.8)
- **INSTRUCTIONS** section: ordered list of 4 steps (number + text)
- **Call-to-action buttons:**
  - Primary button: **"Add to today's plan"** (with icon)
  - Secondary button: **"Save for later"** (with icon)

### 5. Details Page — Button Functionality
- Clicking **"Add to today's plan"**:
  - Adds the workout to the **Today's Plan** tab on the My Plan page.
  - Increments the "Plan" badge counter in the navbar.
  - Shows a **toast notification** (e.g. "Added to today's plan").
- Clicking **"Save for later"**:
  - Adds the workout to the **Saved** tab on the My Plan page.
  - Increments the "Saved" badge counter in the navbar.
  - Shows a **toast notification**.
- On the **My Plan** page, each planned workout card has:
  - **"View Details"** button → opens the workout detail page.

### 6. My Plan Page (`/my-plan`) — the "log" page
Follow the live site + design exactly:
- Title: **"MY PLAN"**, subtitle: *"Cap of five lifts for today. Finish them, then load more."*
- **Metrics Summary row** (3 stat cards): `Exercises`, `Minutes`, `Calories` — start at 0 and update live as items are added/removed from the plan.
- **Tabs**: `Today's Plan` / `Saved` (active tab highlighted).
- **Loading state**: show "Loading workouts…" while fetching before the list renders.
- **Workout cards list**: each entry shows thumbnail, title (e.g. "RUSSIAN TWIST"), equipment (e.g. "Medicine Ball"), and a stats row with duration / calories / rating icons + action buttons (View Details / Mark as Done / X remove).
- **Empty state** (when the list is empty): "NOTHING HERE YET", text *"Browse the library and add a lift to get today moving."*, and a CTA button **"Go to workouts"** (links back to `/`).

### 7. Footer
- Match the Figma design: dark footer.
- **Left**: brand logo icon + **FITLOG**.
- **Right**: copyright line: *"© 2026 FitLog — Workout Library. Train hard, log honest."*

### 8. Responsive Design
- The entire website must work correctly on mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes (grid collapses correctly, navbar stays usable, hero stacks, etc.).

--- 

#	Requirement
- Add a 404 Page for any unknown/invalid route
- Show a loading animation while the exercise data is being fetched on the Home page
- Show a relevant toast notification when the detail's page button.
- Make sure reloading any page after deployment does not cause an error

--- 

# Other Requirements —


### 1. - **Sort dropdown**: 
"Sort By" → options `Duration`, `Calories`, `Rating` (default `Duration`, with chevron icon); it re-sorts the current list.

### 2. GitHub README
- Add a well-designed `README.md` that includes:
  - Project name
  - Short description
  - Technologies used
  - 5 key features of the project

### 3. - On the **My Plan** page, each planned workout card has:
  - **"Mark as Done"** button (with check icon) → marks the workout done, shows a toast.
  - **Remove (X)** button → removes the workout, shows a toast.

--- 

## More Requirements
- Persist the plan/saved data in `localStorage` so it survives a page reload.
- Search the My Plan / library entries by workout name or tag.
- Disable "Add to today's plan" when the plan already contains 5 lifts (the cap mentioned in the subtitle).
